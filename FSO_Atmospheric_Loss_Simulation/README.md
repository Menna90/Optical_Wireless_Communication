# üì° Free-Space Optical (FSO) Link Simulation: Received Power vs Distance

This MATLAB project simulates a **Free-Space Optical (FSO) communication link** and analyzes how the received optical power varies with **link distance** under different **weather conditions**.

## üî¨ **Theory**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Free-Space Optical Communication
- FSO systems transmit data using light through open air, similar to fiber optics but without the fiber.
- Advantages: High bandwidth, immunity to electromagnetic interference.
- Limitation: Highly sensitive to atmospheric conditions.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Free-Space Path Loss (FSPL)
- Light traveling through free space experiences spreading loss.
- FSPL (in dB) is calculated using:
`FSPL = 20 * log10(d) + 20 * log10(f) + 20 * log10(4œÄ / c)`
where:
- `d` = distance in meters
- `f` = frequency in Hz
- `c` = speed of light (3 √ó 10‚Å∏ m/s)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Atmospheric Attenuation
- **Beer-Lambert Law** describes how atmospheric particles (fog, rain, dust) cause exponential decay of signal power.
- The received power is given by:

  `Pr(d) = Pt * exp(-Œ≥ * d)`
  where:
- `Pt` is the transmitter power,
- `Œ≥` is the attenuation coefficient in dB/km,
- `d` is the distance in meters.

## üìà **What This Code Does**

- Defines a range of link distances (100 m to 2000 m).
- Calculates FSPL for reference.
- Computes received power for 3 weather conditions:
- Clear Air (low attenuation)
- Light Fog (moderate attenuation)
- Heavy Fog (high attenuation)
- Plots `Received Power (dBm)` vs `Distance (m)`.

## üöÄ **How To Use**

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- MATLAB installed (any version supporting basic plotting).

### ‚úÖ Run the Code
1. Copy the entire `.m` script into your MATLAB workspace.
2. Run the script.  
3. The plot will show how received power drops with distance for each weather scenario.
